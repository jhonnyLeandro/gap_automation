## Building the project

The first thing that we have to be sure about, Is that we have node.js installed in our machines, so if you don't have it installed, that will be your first move, install node.js, we are building this project with node.js v12.16.2.  

The following step will be to check if you have java installed in your system, if don't please install java version 8 or above.

Now with those requisites completed we can start to build our UI automation project


- First create a folder to contain our project in our case I'm gonna call it gap_project but you can name it whatever you want.

**Create folder and navigate to it**

`mkdir gap_project && cd gap_project`
